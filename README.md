# tahti default library

This repository contains the samples and patterns that make up the default library of [tahti.studio](https://tahti.studio).

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to submit original sample packs via pull requests.

Each sample pack has a dedicated folder below `/packs` containing:
- a metadata file named `meta.yaml`
- a cover image named `image.jpg`
- a `samples` folder containing all the .WAV samples

**Please note:**
- all samples need to be recorded or otherwise created by yourself; no repurposing of existing samples
- once a PR is merged, the samples will become part of this public repository and the license will apply to them
- only high-quality samples that provide a meaningful extension to the existing library will be accepted
